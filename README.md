# Movie Review Application 

The Movie Review Application is a dynamic platform for movie enthusiasts to share their opinions and ratings on their favorite films, developed using React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. This combination of technologies ensures a responsive, user-friendly interface and a robust, scalable application backend capable of managing large volumes of data efficiently.

## Features

## Prerequisites

To successfully run and develop the Movie Review Application, the following technologies need to be installed and configured on your development environment:

- Node.js and npm: Required for managing the application's dependencies and running the React frontend.
- React: The frontend is built with React, so familiarity with React and its ecosystem is necessary.
- Spring Boot: Knowledge and setup of Spring Boot are essential for understanding and running the backend server.
- MongoDB: The application uses MongoDB as its database, so having MongoDB installed and understanding its basic operations are prerequisites.

## Installation

### Backend Setup

- Clone the backend repository and navigate into the project directory. https://github.com/couman05/Movie-review-application-backend/tree/master
- Ensure MongoDB is running on your machine.
- Use Maven to build and run the Spring Boot application, which will serve as the API for the frontend.

### Frontend Setup

- After the backend is up and running, clone the frontend repository.
- Navigate to the frontend project directory.
- Install the necessary npm packages by running `npm install`.
- Start the React application with `npm start`. The frontend will connect to the backend server for data operations.
